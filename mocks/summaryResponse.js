"The first of the EU referendum debates featuring the prime minister began on Thursday night on Sky News, after lengthy wrangling over TV formats because of David Cameron’s reluctance to debate with leading leave campaign figures from his own party.",
"The programme will be split between a face-to-face live interview with the Sky News political editor, Faisal Islam, and a question and answer session in front of a live studio audience, moderated by newsreader Kay Burley.",
"Gove, the justice secretary and a key figure in the leave campaign, will face the same Sky News format 24 hours after Cameron.",
"The debate is likely to be uncomfortable for some on the Brexit side because Farage is not part of the official Vote Leave campaign, who accused ITV of letting Cameron pick his opponent to avoid any more “blue on blue” debates.",
"In the first of the two programmes, Gove will put the case for the UK leaving the EU to a Question Time audience in Nottingham, moderated by David Dimbleby."
